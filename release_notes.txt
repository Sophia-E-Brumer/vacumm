Version 2.4.0
=============

- Added regrid2dnew with tool and method keywords.
- Added dstwgt method for fortran interpolators from gridded to random points.


Version 2.3.0
=============

- Added the new CurvedInterpolator based on some fortran code 
  primarily used for computing transects.
- New regrid1dnew that can regrid from a variable 1D axis to another 
  variable 1D axis, like for instance from sigma to sigma coordinates.
  It will later replace regrid1d. Extrapolation in regrid1dnew is 
  now available for all methods.
- Improvements for staggered grids in Dataset.
- minimap can now display background data instead of ocean color.
- cf: added wspd and wdir for wind.
- Smaller data samples.
- Better management of staggering in Dataset and arakawa (still experimental).
- Removed setup.cfg and added two templates, with a simple one and
  another one for OpenMP parallelisation.
- Fixed issues: vacumm config, sigma2depth, grid2xy, format_var, 
  fortran_domain, etc.
