- Plot.add_point() like methods now accept time arguments if applicable.
- Tuples can be used to specify in time in time creation routines of atime.
- Fixed bugs: list_forecast_files, Plot.add_lon/lat.
- Fixed: ConfigManager.opt_parse.

Version 2.5.0

- Added: misc.plot.advanced.add_things tutorial.
- Fixed: gen_gallery.

Version 2.4.2

Version 2.4.1
==============

- Upgraded: Logger.
- Added: docversions sphinx extension.
- Fixed: ConfigManager.opt_parse/arg_parse, Shapes, get_proj, get_xy,
  seawater import, are_good_units, Shapes.__init__/plot.

Version 2.4.0
==============

- Added: Added fp + th1p + some wind variables to cf.
- Added: add_arrow method to Plot2D.
- Added: add_map_places plot function.
- Improved: In curve2, an array can be passed to fill_between keyword.
- Fixed: ConfigManager, polygon_select, polygon_mask, coord2slice, sigma,
  tide.filters, StepsNorm, list_forecast_files, NEMO.

Version 2.3.1
=============

- Fortran regrid1d routines work directly with missing values.
- Unit tests save outputs in scripts directory.
- Fixed installation issue with setup.*.
- Fixed bugs: list_forecast_files, filter_selector, NEMO, coord2slice.

Version 2.3.0
=============

- Added the new CurvedInterpolator based on some fortran code
  primarily used for computing transects.
- New regrid1dnew that can regrid from a variable 1D axis to another
  variable 1D axis, like for instance from sigma to sigma coordinates.
  It will later replace regrid1d. Extrapolation in regrid1dnew is
  now available for all methods.
- Improvements for staggered grids in Dataset.
- minimap can now display background data instead of ocean color.
- cf: added wspd and wdir for wind.
- Smaller data samples.
- Better management of staggering in Dataset and arakawa (still experimental).
- Removed setup.cfg and added two templates, with a simple one and
  another one for OpenMP parallelisation.
- Fixed issues: vacumm config, sigma2depth, grid2xy, format_var,
  fortran_domain, etc.
